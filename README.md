# Custom-build-form

## Requirements 

- Create a custom build form – the user can add or remove fields at will. (The fields to be added or deleted have to be of just 2 types – text & select)
- When the user saves the data from the form, all the data has to be displayed in a table.
- The table will have at the header the name of each field, for example First name, and in the first row the answers of the form submitted, for example Dimitris.
